# Eclipse Setup for Developers

- Get Gradle support by installing the Eclipse plugin "Buildship: ..." in version 2 or above.
- If you have already imported leadwire-javaagent in Eclipse, delete it
- Import leadwire-javaagent in Eclipse by importing it as gradle project (Eclipse will also import all submodules automatically)
- Whenever you change a build.gradle file, regenerate the .project and .classpath files for Eclipse by using "Gradle->Refresh Gradle Project"
